# Check available seats for courses at Boston University

## Description

At Boston University, (or any university), it is relevant and important to be able to easily check for how many seats are left for a course that you are interested in. This app uses a back-end Python script, which scrapes and parses the contents of a specified search query, and locates the appropriate tag containing the number of seats left. This output is then transferred to a user-friendly app. The front-end is in C and XML, using the GTK API, and the Glade UI-designer.

## Usage example

The below images illustrate how the app works:
